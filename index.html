            <h3>ACCESS/S1S Summer School Enrollment</h3>
            <p>
              The ACCESS Program in Orange County provides resources for high
              school students to earn their diploma and provide college
              readiness for students who cannot otherwise attend traditional
              classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The electronic application for Summer School courses is done using
              a
              <strong
                ><a

                  >Docusign</a

              >, where students parents and counselors can enroll in summer
              coursework and counselors retain their application and signatures
              electronically. The Software Applications team at OCDE developed
              the forms and templates and I created the bulk import templates to
              deliver the applications to over 14,000 students in eleven high
              school districts in Orange County.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data is extracted using Docusign Retrieve and housed in a Data
              Warehouse. We provide set up for the extracting the data,
              providing real-time application status in Tableau reports and
              daashboards. The adminiistrators can then export the results of
              Complete/Incomplete status' of the application process.

            <h3>OCDE Listserv Maestro Mail Jobs</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to the administration of the nearly 300 lists living
              in the OCDE Listserv Maestro platform, I also support the use of
              mail jobs, which is the email marketing system offered with this
              system. This is an example of the types of mail jobs I have
              created. Though the site offers its own clunkier version of
              templates, I create an html file and aid in the implementation of
              a list group's email campaign.

              is a Microsoft Content Management System (CMS) used to build and
              organize websites and its content. I administer the creation of
              pages, content and users of the thousands of pages created by
              OCDE, and I add minor customizations to web pages, both in our
              Intranet and public facing site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we have a framework where users primarily add objects
              that stack in block format by default, I will also add CSS into
              the elements to extend its design capability. I also provide
              remote learning and troubleshooting of any issues users may have,
              either via email or in the event of a critical issue, remote
              sessions where I can make corrections in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also manage several Wordpress websites for special groups who
              have hired third party vendors to develop a site with the
              Wordpress platform. I implement the security updates to the site
              and numerous plugins. It can be a challenge, especially with the
              number of different templates and plugins that I must learn to
              quickly understand and manage. On one occasion, a site was
              completely down and the group who used it could no longer log into
              the Admin location. Through their hosting service, I was able to
              shut down all of the plugins and one by one manually troubleshoot
              the more than 60 plugins and bring their site back online.
